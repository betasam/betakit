README

Build now uses configure.pl which uses perl's all powerful recursive
descent parser in bkparse.pm and parses kernel config like *.bconfig
files. Early stage testing is positive.

Date: 23-Dec-2010

This directory has scripts used for configuration and
building betakit applications. The intention is to use
linux/kernel Config style configuration files to 
configure the kit for use and deployment. Such a system
would allow easy use/re-use of kernel source trees for
target builds.
