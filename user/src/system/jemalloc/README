jemalloc is a general-purpose scalable concurrent malloc(3) implementation.
This distribution is a stand-alone "portable" implementation that currently
targets Linux and Apple OS X.  jemalloc is included as the default allocator in
the FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems, and it is used by the Mozilla Firefox
web browser on Microsoft Windows-related platforms.  Depending on your needs,
one of the other divergent versions may suit your needs better than this
distribution.

The COPYING file contains copyright and licensing information.

The INSTALL file contains information on how to configure, build, and install
jemalloc.

The ChangeLog file contains a brief summary of changes for each release.
